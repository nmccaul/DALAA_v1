# Progress

One entry per pass, newest last. Setup (2026-10-29, interactive session): LTI key 10000000000013 + deployment, API key 10000000000014, test course 42, env vars, AI Gateway key. See ralph/PLAN.md.

## 2026-10-29 06:23 UTC · T01 Decisions + docs · done
- Added D-020…D-026 to `docs/DECISIONS.md` (LTI now for gitgrade, Study Chat + modes, Supabase Auth into `admit()`, shared test teacher, self-signup + link by email, email login IDs, AI Gateway). D-020 also records that LTI instructors are admitted per course without the allowlist (T08 needs this). D-008 row notes Study Chat for gitgrade, still open for BYU.
- Updated `docs/ROADMAP.md` (new "Now" section, LTI out of v3), `docs/PRD.md` (non-goals, student flow, stack, tools), `CLAUDE.md` Canvas section (`src/lti/`, login IDs, Supabase rule, AGS), and an amendment note in `docs/CANVAS.md` sign-in rules.
- `.env.example` lists every PLAN env var with empty values (examples in comments).
- Surprise: PGlite tests flaked on vitest's 5 s timeout under load; raised `testTimeout` to 30 s in `vitest.config.mts` (separate commit). No tests skipped.
- Nathan: skim D-020…D-026 wording; `src/auth/admit.ts` comment still says "sign-in never creates a student" — T02/T10 will update the code.
